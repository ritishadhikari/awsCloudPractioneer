Module 1: Introduction to Amazon Web Services

AWS Service offerings:
    - Compute
    - Storage
    - Network Security
    - Blockchain
    - Machine Learning
    - Artificial Intelligence
    - Robot Development
    - Video Production
    - Orbital Satellites 

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2): It is a virtual Server in the cloud. 

Pay for what you need becomes the key point for running your business on AWS. 

Module 2: Getting Started with Cloud Acquisition

AWS responsibility includes:
    - Compute
    - Storage
    - Database
    - Networking

AWS global infrastructure includes:
    - Regions
    - Availability Zones
    - Edge Locations

Six key areas affect how cloud is bought: Pricing, Security, Data Residency, Sustainability, 
Governance and terms and conditions. 

Module 3: AWS Well Architected Framework

A Workload is defined as a collection of interrelated applications, infrastructure, policy, governance
and operations running on AWS that provide business or operational value. 

In the cloud Environment, customers can:
    - Stop guessing capacity needs
    - Test at production Scale
    - Make experimentation easier
    - Allow for architectures to evolve
    - Build Data Driven architectures
    - Improve through game days

Pillars of Well Architected Framework:
    - Operational Excellence: The Ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to 
    continually improve supporting processes and procedures.
    - Security: The ability to protect information, systems and assets while delivering business 
    value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies
    - Reliability: The Ability to recover from failures and meet demand.
    - Performance Efficiency: The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system 
    requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technology evolves
    - Cost Optimization: The ability to achieve business outcomes at the lowest price point.

Amazon Congnito: 
    - Supports Multiple Login Providers
    - Unique Users/devices
    - Helps implement security best practices

AWS provides a way to record resource configuration changes as they occur, and evaluate them against rules 
you configure by the AWS configuration service. With conformance packs for AWS config, you configure rules
coupled with automated remediation. This enables us to automate response to misconfigurations. 

Reliability is the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when
it's expected to. This includes the ability operate and test the workload through its total lifecyle.
To achive Reliability, we focus on resiliency:
    - Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
    - Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
    - Mitigate Disruptions


Getting Started with AWS Cloud Essentials:

Core AWS Services are:
    - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
    - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
    - Amazon Storage:
        - S3
        - Elastic Bean Stalk
        - Elastic File System
        - S3 Glacier
    - Databases:
        - Amazon Relational Database Service
        - Amazon Dynamo DB
    - AWS Identity and Management (IAM)

The AWS Global Infrastructure is designed and built to deliver a flexible, reliable, scalable and secure 
cloud computing environment with high quality global network performance. 

In an AWS Region:
    - Data Replication across regions is controlled by you
    - Communication between Regions uses AWS backbone network infrastructure.

AWS recommends replicating data and resources across Availability Zones for resiliency.

EC2 autoscaling detects impaired EC2 instances and unhealthy applications and replaces the instances 
without your intervention. It provides several scaling options - manual, scheduled, dynamic or on-demand 
and predictive.

Elastic File System is ideal when there are multiple instances that needs to use the same storage.
